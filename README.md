## Synopsis for rar-menu-tools

RAR for Mac OS X. Finally the tool you have been looking for to directly create RAR files and UnRAR files from within your Macintosh user interface. It even supports version 5 RAR compression & decompression!

## Code Example

Screenshots and usage directions are available from the instruction file found inside the disk image MDG file.

## Motivation

Only this tool allows the creation of version 5 RAR archives on Mac within the graphical user interface (GUI). There are some tools to UnRAR file on Macintosh already, however,
only rar-menu-tools supports both version 5 and earlier version archive decompression. If you are using some other developer's free utility that errors because it cannot open,
just use my utility, it will probably work.

## Installation

IMPORTANT: make certain that you read the installation instructions within the Mac DMG file BEFORE attempting to install. My app will only work correctly when the 
supporting RAR library file is included during the install process; for copyright integrity reasons I am not permitted to distribute that file. Read the instruction file before continuing.

## Tests

Right&ndash;click a file to RAR archive it from the Macintosh Services menu option.

## Contributors

If you would like to see how the code works, feel free to dive into the code using an Apple Macintosh's Automator program and opening the Install folder to browse for containing files.
The app works on automator scripts and not compiled applications.
